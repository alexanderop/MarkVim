// REFACTORED IMPLEMENTATION - AFTER APPLYING BEST PRACTICES
// This file now uses the improved architecture with reusable steps and page objects
// Most of the step definitions have been moved to more specific files:
// - markvim-ui.steps.ts: MarkVim-specific UI interactions
// - common.steps.ts: Reusable steps that can be used across features
// - responsive.steps.ts: Responsive design specific steps

// This file is kept for backward compatibility and legacy step definitions
// Consider migrating remaining steps to appropriate domain-specific files

// Note: Browser setup and teardown is now handled in tests/support/world.ts
// Note: MarkVim-specific steps are now in tests/steps/markvim-ui.steps.ts
// Note: Common reusable steps are now in tests/steps/common.steps.ts

// This file intentionally left minimal to show the migration path
// All functionality has been moved to more appropriate, domain-specific files

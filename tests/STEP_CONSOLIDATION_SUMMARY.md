# Cucumber Step Consolidation Summary

## Overview
The Cucumber step definitions have been restructured to eliminate duplication and promote reusability by grouping steps by their step type (Given, When, Then) rather than by feature file.

## New Structure

### Before (7 separate files):
- `common.steps.ts` - Generic reusable steps
- `keyboard-shortcuts.steps.ts` - Keyboard shortcuts specific steps  
- `markvim-ui.steps.ts` - UI interaction steps
- `settings-clear-data.steps.ts` - Settings and data clearing steps
- `sync-scroll.steps.ts` - Synchronized scrolling steps
- `markvim-share.steps.ts` - Share functionality steps
- `markvim.steps.ts` - Legacy file with refactoring notes

### After (3 consolidated files):
- `01-given.steps.ts` - All Given step definitions
- `02-when.steps.ts` - All When step definitions  
- `03-then.steps.ts` - All Then step definitions

## Benefits

### 1. Elimination of Duplicates
Several step definitions were duplicated across files, such as:
- Multiple "I press" variations in different files
- Redundant modal visibility checks
- Duplicate page navigation steps
- Similar element interaction patterns

### 2. Forced Reusability
By organizing steps by their Gherkin keyword rather than feature domain:
- Writers are more likely to find and reuse existing steps
- Similar functionality is grouped together, making it easier to spot patterns
- New features naturally leverage existing step definitions

### 3. Easier Maintenance
- Single location for each type of step definition
- Easier to update step implementations across all features
- Reduced risk of inconsistent behavior between similar steps

### 4. Better Organization
- Steps are now organized by their linguistic function (Given/When/Then)
- Each file has a clear responsibility and purpose
- Logical grouping makes it easier to find relevant steps

## Consolidated Step Examples

### Generic Element Interactions (now in When/Then files)
```gherkin
When I click on element with testid "button-id"
When I type "text" in element with testid "input-id"
Then element with testid "element-id" should be visible
Then element with testid "element-id" should contain text "expected"
```

### Keyboard and UI Actions (now in When file)
```gherkin
When I press "Escape"
When I press "Cmd+K"  
When I open the command palette
When I open the settings modal
```

### State Verification (now in Then file)
```gherkin
Then the keyboard shortcuts modal should be visible
Then the settings modal should be visible
Then line numbers should be toggled
Then vim mode should be toggled
```

## Impact on Feature Files
Feature files remain unchanged - all existing step definitions continue to work exactly as before. The consolidation is transparent to the test scenarios.

## Testing Verification
All 43 scenarios with 303 steps continue to pass after the consolidation, confirming that:
- No functionality was broken during the refactor
- All step definitions were properly migrated
- The consolidated structure works correctly with existing features

## Recommendations for Future Development
1. **Check existing step files first** - Before creating new step definitions, search the consolidated files for similar functionality
2. **Use consistent patterns** - Follow the established patterns for element interactions and assertions
3. **Prefer generic over specific** - Create reusable step definitions that can work across multiple features
4. **Maintain the structure** - Continue adding new steps to the appropriate Given/When/Then file based on their function

/**
 * Editor Module Events
 *
 * Events that the editor module publishes and responds to.
 *
 * **Event Documentation Template:**
 * ```ts
 * 'event:key': {
 *   // Your payload type
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Each event should include comprehensive JSDoc:
 * - **Purpose:** What this event does and when it's triggered
 * - **Type:** Fire-and-forget UI signal / logging / analytics (never state transfer)
 * - **Producer:** Code example showing where/how the event is emitted
 * - **Consumer:** Code example showing where/how the event is handled
 *
 * @example
 * Add events following this pattern:
 * 'editor:example': { data: string }
